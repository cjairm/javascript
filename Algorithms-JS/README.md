## Frecuency Counters

* "This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frecuencies of values." Colt Steele. 
* "This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings." Colt Steele. 
* Examples. 
    * [Anagram](https://github.com/cjairm/javascript/tree/master/Algorithms-JS/001_anagram)

## Multiple Pointers

* "Creating pointers of values that correspond to an ondex or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition." Colt Steele. 
* "Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well." Colt Steele. 
* Examples. 
    * [Count Unique Values](https://github.com/cjairm/javascript/tree/master/Algorithms-JS/002_count_unique_values)
    * [Pair That Sum Zero](https://github.com/cjairm/javascript/tree/master/Algorithms-JS/004_pair_that_sum_zero)

## Sliding Window

* "This pattern involves creating a `window` which can either be an array or number from one position to another." Colt Steele.
* "Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and new window is created)." Colt Steele.
* "Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc." Colt Steele.
* Example. 
    * [Max sub array sum](https://github.com/cjairm/javascript/tree/master/Algorithms-JS/005_max_sub_array_sum)

## Divide and Conquer 
* "This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data." Colt Steele.
* "This pattern can tremendously `decrease time complexity`." Colt Steele.
* Example. 
    * [Search a number](https://github.com/cjairm/javascript/tree/master/Algorithms-JS/006_search_a_number)
